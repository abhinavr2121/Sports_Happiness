SPORTS VS. HAPPINESS PROJECT (2019)
Hypotheses:
1. The existence of national sports team(s) correlate to a stronger position on the World Happiness Index.
      a) Compare average WHI position of countries that have < 2 sports teams with those that have >= 2 (confirmed)
2. The existence of both a men's and women's team correlates to a stronger position on the WHI.
      a) Compare average WHI position of countries that have only men's teams (Middle East) with those that have women's teams too (lurking variable: gender equality boosts happiness) (confirmed)
3. The more sports teams a country is engaged in, the higher they will rank on the WHI.
      a) Correlation --> total number of sports teams vs. WHI (confirmed)
4. Number of sports teams does not necessarily stem from higher GDP
      a) Correlation --> GDP vs. total number of sports teams (disproved)
5. Curious about effect of rank on position in WHI
      a) Average sports rank score per country, correlate with WHI (confirmed)

DATA:
156 countries from the World Happiness Report (2018)[cite]
GDP for each country 2018 --> World Bank
Women's T20 Cricket Rankings --> ESPN
Men's T20 Cricket Rankings --> Wikipedia
Women's Soccer --> FIFA
Men's Soccer --> FIFA
Men's Rugby --> World Rugby
Women's Rugby --> Scrum Queens
Men's/Women's Basketball --> FIBA
Men's/Women's Field Hockey --> FIH
Men's/Women's Water Polo --> FINA
Men's/Women's Volleyball --> FIVB

Recognized International Team Sports used for this project (either gender):
- Football (European) (x)
- Rugby (x)
- Cricket (x)
- Outdoor Field Hockey (x)
- Basketball (x)
- Water Polo (x)
- Volleyball (x)

Minimized correlation between variables (i.e. not including futsal because football exists)

METHODOLOGY:
1. Join data on country name for all sports
2. Exploratory data analysis (average "sports score", distribution of number of sports teams, number of women/men teams distribution, best ranking men's/women's sports countries)
3. Plot World Happiness Index vs. GDP
4. Join data on World Happiness Index
5. Assign "team sports score" with an equation --> penalize lack of sports teams (with a -1?), reward dual-gender  (try weighting women's teams differently)
6. Carry out experiments in "Hypotheses" section

DATA FORMATTING:
- Since not having a specific team should be a larger penalty, missing team values will be assumed to have a rank of 157 (since there are 156 countries on this list). [not doing this]

COUNTRY PERFORMANCE AVERAGES:
Unweighted: simple average
Weighted: zeta * # missing teams + sum(156 / Rank.M) + alpha * sum(156 / Rank.W)
FINDINGS:
Sports correlates weakly with GDP
Sports correlates weakly with Happiness
GDP correlates strongly with Happiness
--> international sports teams are a possible index of measuring happiness
